# CustomBot
In the rapidly evolving digital era, websites frequently encounter challenges in delivering swift and tailored support to their online visitors. This deficiency often results in users becoming frustrated and ultimately leaving the website without achieving their goals. In response to this issue, our project centers on the creation of an advanced chatbot, leveraging the capabilities of a sophisticated large language model. The primary objective of this chatbot is to function as a virtual assistant that can promptly respond to user queries in real time. It will not only provide immediate answers but also act as a guide, leading users through various processes and furnishing them with pertinent information. By doing so, our chatbot aims to alleviate user frustrations, enhance engagement, and contribute to a more satisfactory online experience.

 In this project, we use large language models with Lang chain frameworks which helps to make conversational bot more specific to certain tasks rather than being more general. Using Langchain’s preprocessing method is a critical feature that is unavoidable as LLMs become more powerful and data-intensive. Lang Chain streamlines the development of diverse applications, such as chatbots, Generative Question-Answering (GQA), and summarization. By “chaining” components from multiple modules, it allows for the creation of unique applications built around an LLM.
