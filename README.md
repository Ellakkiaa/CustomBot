# CustomBot
- This project centers on the creation of an advanced chatbot, leveraging the capabilities of a sophisticated large language model. The primary objective of this chatbot is to function as a virtual assistant that can promptly respond to user queries in real time. 
- In this project, I have used large language models with Lang chain frameworks which helps to make conversational bot more specific to certain tasks rather than being more general. Using Langchain’s preprocessing method is a critical feature that is unavoidable as LLMs become more powerful and data-intensive. 
- Lang Chain streamlines the development of diverse applications, such as chatbots, Generative Question-Answering (GQA), and summarization. By “chaining” components from multiple modules, it allows for the creation of unique applications built around an LLM.
